# Role Scouting: Searching for a Right Centre Back Replacement
 Stade Rennais Technical Interview for Data Scientist position in the First Team Performance and Recruitment Team

## Overview
In this project, I was tasked with finding a replacement for Stade Rennais' Right Centre Back position. The goal was to analyze summarized event data of Center Backs, filter down a list of 100 players to the final 5 candidates, and ultimately choose the best-suited player for our team.

### Data Used
Excel file containing Statsbomb summarized event data of Center Backs from the 2022/2023 season.

## Project Approach
### Data Evaluation and Preprocessing
I began by thoroughly examining the provided data, which contained summarized event data of Center Backs. To ensure accurate analysis, I cleaned and preprocessed the data, extracting relevant features crucial for evaluating players.

### Filtering Players
Next, I employed a systematic approach to filter the initial list of 100 players based on specific key performance indicators (KPIs) pertinent to the Right Centre Back position. Through a series of evaluations, I narrowed down the list to 50, then to 20, and eventually identified the top 5 candidates using rigorous selection criteria.

### Final Player Selection
The final 5 players underwent an in-depth evaluation considering essential factors such as defensive stats, passing accuracy, positioning, aerial duels won, interceptions, and other crucial metrics relevant to the Right Centre Back role. Finally, I justified the selection of the ultimate player based on their performance, adaptability, and suitability for the team's tactics and club philosphy.

### Code Structure
The Python code I developed is organized, commented, and structured to demonstrate a logical flow. It showcases the step-by-step process of data preprocessing, filtering, analysis, and final player selection. The schematic structure in the code outlined the decision-making process employed throughout the analysis.
